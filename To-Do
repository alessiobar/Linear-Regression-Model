Data Understanding:
  Year va considerata come numerica??
  normalizzare Ã¨ meglio per lasso?
Data Cleaning:
  - Remove predictors with more than 15% NA
  - Remove Na from train and test (with data understanding)
  - Remove Outlier from train and test (using only data from train)
  - Remove NearZeroVariance columns
  - Normalization(interval) and Centering(i.e. skeweness)
  - Dummy Variable (using OneHot and trying to find better approaches)

Feture Selection:
  - Remove low correlated predictors
  - Lasso for selectiong predictors
  - Principal Component Analysis
  - Random Forest Predictors Importance
  
 Models: (capire quali posso fare sulle categoriche)
  - Linear Model
  - Random Forest
  - ?Ridge/Lasso/Elastic-net
  - Gradient Boosting Machine
  - Xgboosting

  Cose:
  -Perhaps the most simple, quick and direct way to mean-center your data is by using the function scale(). By default, 
  this function will standardize the data (mean zero, unit variance). To indicate that we just want to subtract the mean, we 
  need to turn off the argument scale = FALSE.
  -Settare un cazzo di seed
